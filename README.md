Image segmentation using contour detection

###### I wrote a simple code to find contours by both the apraoches.you can check out the code to see how it works .
* Input image
> ![input image](/images/dhoni_virat.jpg)

* contour tracing thresholding image(threshold value-115)
![threshold](/images/Threshold.PNG)

* contour tracing after edge detection (threshold1 value-115 ,threshol2 40)
![threshold](images/canny.PNG)

**we can see clearly that the image after edge detection gave better results than simple thresholding**
